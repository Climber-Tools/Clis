# Scanning climbing walls
A short tutorial on how to do photogrammetry on various types of climbing walls. Most of this is my personal opinion, formed by experimentation and various blog posts / YouTube videos about photogrammetry, so take it with a grain of salt.

I will leave links to the resources that I used while figuring things out where appropriate.
